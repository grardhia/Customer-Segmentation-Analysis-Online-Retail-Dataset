# **Customer Segmentation Analysis : Online Retail Dataset**

---

## Project Overview

In this project, we will analyze patterns in the *Online Retail Dataset* from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Our goal is to segment customers into specific groups using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** principle. By using this method, we aim to uncover meaningful insights that can help optimize marketing strategies, enhance customer engagement, and drive business growth. This approach allows us to categorize customers based on their recent purchasing behavior, frequency of purchases, and the monetary value of their transactions.

2. **Customer Segmentation Analysis (Notebook)**  
   - A Jupyter Notebook containing the full Python code, analysis steps, and results.
